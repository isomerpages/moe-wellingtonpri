“… and if I could pick my primary school again, it would still be Wellington.”

A lot of time has passed since I graduated from Wellington. Then I was in the Art Club for my first three years, which was at that time headed by Ms Rahayu and Mr Wee Chee Kok. I have fond memories there of batik dying (I thought more dye would look better), and of working together with seniors on art pieces to place around the school. I remember fondly that the piece I worked on was displayed outside the staff room for a period of time, and the part I contributed to was the very unusual shading of the ocean on the left (they told me to shade, but not when to stop!).
