<strong> W </strong> ellington is special <br>
**E** ver since I came to Singapore I had this feeling that <br>
**L** anguage challenges could not stop me from <br>
**L** ater excelling under the care of the teachers. <br>
**I** knew Wellington will be where it all begins. <br>
**N** ot once afraid, I knew I was ready for PSLE , and I have <br>
**G** rown since graduation, ready to pursue my passion for science, as the <br>
**T** eachers in Wellington have given me confidence which helped me <br>
**O** vercome so many obstacles. <br>
**N** ot a single strand of memory here shall fade.
