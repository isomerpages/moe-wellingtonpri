<strong> W </strong> ellington is special <br>
<strong> E </strong> ver since I came to Singapore I had this feeling that <br>
<strong> L </strong> anguage challenges could not stop me from <br>
<strong> L </strong> ater excelling under the care of the teachers. <br>
<strong> I </strong> knew Wellington will be where it all begins. <br>
<strong> N </strong> ot once afraid, I knew I was ready for PSLE , and I have <br>
<strong> G </strong> rown since graduation, ready to pursue my passion for science, as the <br>
<strong> T </strong> eachers in Wellington have given me confidence which helped me <br>
<strong> O </strong> vercome so many obstacles. <br>
<strong> N </strong> ot a single strand of memory here shall fade.
