### “… you will never know what you can do unless you try.”

I remember the day I first stepped into Wellington Primary School 14 years ago. School was a daunting thing for me at the tender age of 7; many things were unknown to me at that time. I was a challenge for many of my teachers, but they stood by me from the start. The 6 years in primary school went by in a hurry. In that time, I met amazing friends, teachers, staff, and grew holistically as a person. Wellington always gave me opportunities to pursue my aspirations, and encouraged me to take part in activities that molded me into a well-rounded individual. One of the highlights of my time in Wellington was winning a Silver award at Elementz 2005, and getting to meet then-President S R Nathan the next year. Well, much more happened along the way but alas, all good things must come to an  end. The teachers at Wellington played a huge role in helping me realise my dreams and I am immensely thankful for their support. Without them, I would not be where I am today.

To the current and future students, I encourage you to utilise your time in Wellington to push yourself and try new things; you will never know what you can do unless you try. The time in primary school will probably be amongst the best years of your life; do not forget to enjoy yourself while you pursue your passions! The friends you meet now will continue to be your friends for many years to come even after you have parted ways. Of course, do not forget those who have helped you along the way, especially your teachers and parents. Don’t feel sad because you are different from others. Dream big and aim high. The one thing that all successful people have in common is that they were different from everyone around them. 

The school is still young and I am confident it will continue to grow and achieve more as each day passes. Wellington was the perfect stepping-stone for me to pursue my dreams, as it has been and will be for generations of students to come. If you can dream it, you can do it. Dare to dream, Wellingtonians!
