### A Future Leader in the Making

![](/images/alumni08.png)

##### Belle Tan graduated in 2012 and is currently a Secondary 3 student of Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (SCGS). This year, she was recently elected a prefect and was also part of the organising team for a recent JIP Leadership Symposium in SCGS. She was also attached to a few school leaders in Wellington during her sabbatical to find out what their daily duties are, how they perform them and how they lead.

“Wellington has given me a very holistic education. I found myself immersed in a myriad of co-curricular activities ranging from guitar and tambourine lessons to computer game-making and leadership training. As a councillor, the hosting of visitors, many of whom were foreigners, provided me with opportunities to hone my public speaking skills and helped me to gain confidence. The Executive Committee was also tasked to organise the Graduation Day and that had given me a first-hand experience in organising an event. I also learnt to manage my time as I had to juggle my studies and my dutiesas the president of the Student Council.  

My aspiration for the near future is to be an inspiring leader in my new junior college because I know I can make a difference to the lives of the people around me. Wellington has given me the skills to not just pursue my own ambitions, but to guide others towards fulfilling their own.”
