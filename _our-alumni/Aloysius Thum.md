### Aloysius Thum, from the class of 2008, served his national service in the Commandos Unit. He will be pursuing his chemical engineering undergraduate studies at NTU. Aloysius is also volunteering as a St. John Ambulance Corps Staff Officer in Maris Stella High, his alma mater.

Having an impressive academic portfolio to secure a good job is no longer what defines success. In Singapore’s competitive social climate, what is valuable about a person isn’t so much the paper qualifications he or she has, but rather the rich experiences they possess and how much he or she can contribute to the society as an individual. For that, I am thankful that Wellington has provided me with a platform to participate in a wide array of activities that have enriched my life experiences. It was through such opportunities that I was nurtured to have a curious mind, and a drive to achieve excellence in whatever I do. 

As a young primary school boy, I was already involved in sports CCAs (Badminton and Volleyball) and honing my leadership skills as the Captain of the Badminton Boys School Team. This love for sports and motivation to excel was prominent in my later years, as I took up Taekwondo and won medals as I represented my junior college in inter-school competitions.

</div> Servant leadership was an inherent value that I brought with me in my endeavours. I graduated as the Distinguished Graduate in the St. John Officer Training Course, and continued to serve in the brigade of my alma mater, Maris Stella High, as a Corps Staff Officer, while juggling with my studies in JC, and serving national service.
