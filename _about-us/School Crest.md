Wellington crest embodies the spirit of a dynamic learning partnership between the school and its stakeholders in response to the emerging challenges in education.  

The stylised **W** stands for **Wellington** with the straight upright lines underscoring the school's effort at inculcating values to our young.

The abstract branches of the tree with the leaf symbolises Wellington's commitment to nurture the growth and development of every individual through quality education.

The brilliant yellow reflects the vibrancy and energy of Wellington in empowering its members through quality education.

The colour blue represents the learner-centred environment, conducive to creativity and innovation.
