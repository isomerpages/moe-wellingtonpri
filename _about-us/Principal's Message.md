Masks are no longer required on public transport from Feb 13, 2023; lifting almost all of our remaining Covid-19 restrictions. Then, we spoke about building the resiliency of our children. Throughout the pandemic, they had to face decreased structure, increased educational barriers, and many disruptions to their everyday activities and lives. Behavioral changes needed to be fast when the pandemic began, such as social distancing, masking all-day and isolation from others.

The easing of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) has brought back almost all normality to student life in our schools even before this latest announcement, but we are cautioned that we cannot rule out the future possibility of dangerous variants of concern emerging. The probability of experiencing another pandemic similar to COVID-19 in one’s lifetime is also possible, if not probable.

When lockdowns began in early 2020, few of us imagined the long road ahead. As the world moves toward normalcy, challenges will continue to arise and for the foreseeable near term, revolves around the pandemic’s knock-on effects. Inflation, possible recession in some countries, a greater acceptance for flexibility in the workplace, the accessibility and necessity of remote work and issues of mental health and well-being becoming more prevalent.

As we transition to endemicity with Covid-19, we ought to learn lessons from it. The crisis has given us many ongoing lessons. We must continue to practice personal and social responsibility in terms of monitoring our health and maintaining hygiene practices. We must also be able to respond nimbly as a community when called upon in times of emergency. It is important that we prepare our children with skills that will make them more resilient and future-ready.

One way to do this is to build our children’s uncertainty tolerance. As Minister Chan said, “If we truly believe in nurturing resilience and building confidence in our young people to face an uncertain and untidy world, we must also be careful to not over-structure, over-provide, or over-protect our younger generation, which would deprive them of the opportunities to grow and learn.”

Sometimes in trying to create the safest path for students, we leave them with no room to exercise their creativity and decision-making skills. Uncertainty can be stressful and challenging, but it is also an opportunity for growth and development. Let us not be so quick to provide answers for our children - let them learn to be more self-directed and resourceful in trying to solve their own problems. A study done by Yale neuroscientists found that uncertainty can be healthy for your brain because you learn more in situations that are unsure.  

We want the students to respond to ambiguity and adapt to change with resilience and grace. In situations beyond their control, their mindset during uncertain times is the most powerful thing they can control. Resilient students interpret academic and social challenges positively by increasing effort, developing new strategies, and practicing conflict resolution. With such positive mindsets towards uncertainty, they are more likely to become more successful at work in the future.

I take this opportunity to wish all Wellingtonians, friends and stakeholders of Wellington Primary School, a happy and successful 2023.
