<p>Established in 2001, Wellington Primary School has grown from strength
to strength from its initial enrolment of 303 students and 14 staff, to
its current more than 1,400 primary students and 250 kindergarteners. Over
the years, Wellington Primary School has celebrated many milestones and
achievements, made possible by the dedication of quality staff as well
as the strong support from our SAC, parents, alumni and community partners.
As we step into the next quarter of the decade as a school, Wellington
Primary School remains steadfast in our mission to empower every individual,
nurture talents and groom leaders who have a strong mission to contribute
meaningfully to the community and nation, as well as in our vision as an
excellent institution that grows future-ready leaders.</p>
<p>The school’s mission and vision have become ever more pertinent with the
revolutionary advancement of Artificial Intelligence and increasing dynamism
of the geopolitical realities. Our students need to <em>feel</em> and <em>be</em> empowered
to navigate these agilely and confidently through education. This starts
with having a healthy sense of self rooted in strong character and values,
a deep sense of empathy for others, and a powerful sense of belonging to
the community and nation. This rootedness would anchor them in the increasingly
complex world, guide them in discovering their interests, and in developing
and deepening their passions. It would also form the foundation for their
confidence and competencies to seize opportunities to nurture their talents,
give back to society and contribute towards leading a stronger community
to navigate uncertainty.</p>
<p>This means that learning and living in Wellington Primary School focusses
on holistic education that balances academics with the care and responsibility
for the community and an unyielding pursuit to develop the competencies
required for our children to thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and shape
their dispositions towards lifelong learning. These include critical, adaptive
and inventive thinking to discern, adapt and create new solutions, digital
and information literacy for good cyber skills for purposeful use of technology,
and the foundational communication and collaboration skills to work with
others. Beyond classroom teaching and learning, we at Wellington Primary
School also stand by providing diverse learning opportunities both locally
and globally to develop character, civic, cultural and global literacy
to develop a global perspective with a local heartbeat in our students.

<p>The journey to grow the school community is an ongoing one that I am privileged
to join, and a collective one that the school walks hand in hand with the
support of the SAC, parents, alumni and community partners. I am grateful
for the stewardship of former Principals before me who have led and grown
the school to what it is today, and for the committed and capable teaching
and non-teaching staff whose tenacity and heart for the students shine
through abundantly. With the strong stakeholder and community partnership,
as well as the deep commitment of staff and students, let us continue to
strive together to provide the empowering holistic education for our students
to thrive and make a difference.</p>
<p>We welcome you to our Wellington family as we continue to forge brave
and innovative pathways in empowering leaders, touching lives and transforming
futures.</p>
