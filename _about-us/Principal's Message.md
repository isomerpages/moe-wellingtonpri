<p><strong>Welcome to 2025: Sustaining Our Efforts, Strengthening Our Community</strong>
</p>
<p>As we step into 2025, our focus at Wellington Primary School remains steadfast:
to nurture students who possess a strong sense of self, empathy for others,
and a deep sense of belonging. We want our students not only to excel academically
but also to grow into productive individuals with a strong mission to contribute
meaningfully to the community.</p>
<p>Building on the transformative shifts outlined in previous years, we continue
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthen 21st Century Competencies (21CC):</strong> Ensuring
students develop the adaptability, resilience, communication and critical
thinking skills needed to navigate an ever-evolving world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harness Technology Responsibly:</strong> Equipping students with
digital literacy and cyber wellness skills for the good and purposeful
use of technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enrich Learning through Experiences &amp; Partnerships:</strong> Providing
diverse learning opportunities that extend beyond the classroom to develop
character, better cultural literacy, and a global perspective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflecting on 2024, we celebrate several key milestones, including our
Performing Arts Night held at the NUS University Cultural Centre, which
showcased our students' talents and creativity. This event was a testament
to the hard work and dedication of our teachers, the enthusiasm and commitment
of our students, and the strong support of our parents. Another highlight
of 2024 were the four Overseas Learning Journeys to Beijing, Shanghai/Wuxi,
Hong Kong and Penang, marking the first such trips after the COVID-19 pandemic.
These journeys were carefully planned to offer our students rich, hands-on
learning experiences, further expanding their horizons and fostering global
awareness.</p>
<p>At Wellington Primary, we believe that learning is best enriched through
experiences. Programmes such as our Values in Action initiatives, Overseas
Learning Journeys, Primary 5 Camp, National Education Learning Journeys
and NE Show, Applied Learning Programme (ALP), and Learning for Life Programme
(LLP) provide vital platforms for students to develop essential skills
while fostering a sense of purpose and responsibility. As the saying goes, <em>“Collect experiences, not things.”</em> We
encourage our students to embrace these opportunities with enthusiasm,
curiosity, and an open mind.</p>
<p>Just as we expect our students to be lifelong learners, our teachers too
are committed to continuous learning. Staying updated on current knowledge
and educational best practices enables them to be better guides and mentors
in shaping our students' growth.</p>
<p>Cyber wellness remains a key priority as we help our students develop
healthy digital habits and navigate the online world safely. At the same
time, strong partnerships with parents and the community are integral to
creating a nurturing and supportive environment for our students.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, 2026 marks a significant milestone for us: Wellington Primary
School will be 25-years old. This milestone presents a timely opportunity
to reflect on our journey and the progress we've made over these 25 years.
It is also a time for us to strengthen our connections with our stakeholders
and continue building new partnerships that will help us achieve greater
heights.</p>
<p>As we embark on 2025 together, we will &nbsp;continue to work hand in
hand—educators, parents, and the wider community—to provide a rich, holistic
education that empowers our students to thrive, contribute, and make a
difference.</p>
<p><strong>Sincerely,<br>Albert Alfred Alcantara<br>Principal<br>Wellington Primary School</strong>
