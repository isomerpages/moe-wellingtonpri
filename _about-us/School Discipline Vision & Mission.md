To empower Wellingtonians to make responsible decisions based on the RICE2 values.

The Personal Mastery Board was established in view of a whole school educative process that teaches values in a structured way so that Wellingtonians are self-disciplined and care for others. 

Self-disciplined Wellingtonians who demonstrate care for others.  

We foster Personal Mastery through our modified Kolb’s Learning Cycle of ‘Learning by doing, doing until we become’ – nurturing the right attitudes by practising the right habits until it becomes engrained into our lives.
