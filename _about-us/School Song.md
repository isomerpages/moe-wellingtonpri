The place we learn to be innovative <br>
Every day every way <br>
Nurture talent and develop character <br>
'Tis the place we’ll shine like a star in life

Confident creative and strong we will be <br>
To take on challenges <br>

We’ll share and care for every one <br>
Empowerment through education <br>
