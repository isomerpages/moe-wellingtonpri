### Our Vision

An excellent department that nurtures inspired inquisitive innovators  

### Our Mission

To develop a lively curiosity of Science among our pupils through the provision of a conducive learning environment

### Department Goals
1. To provide students with experiences to stimulate their curiosity about their environment  
2. To provide a stimulating environment for inquiry-based learning
3. To develop students’ process skills, habits of minds and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry

We aim to provide a curriculum which engages, motivates and inspires confidence in our students and at the same time extend their knowledge through hands-on learning activities. ICT and collaborative skills are also integrated as part of our teaching and learning of Science.

### Our Approach

The Science Department focuses on equipping our young scientists with specific skills and approaches in helping them to understand and relate their scientific concepts better. To that end, the Team uses the RICE technique to help students understand the questions, the topic coverage and answer them in a constructive manner.
