It covers death, permanent and total/partial disability and medical due to an accident. Details on the insurance coverage can be found in the [factsheet](/files/GPA%20Product%20Fact%20Sheet%202022.pdf).

With effect from 2022, parents are to submit student accident insurance claims electronically at [https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg](https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/).
