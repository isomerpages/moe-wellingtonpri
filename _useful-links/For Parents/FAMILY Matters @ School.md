Family Matters @ School (FMS) is an initiative by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to equip parents and young adults with skills to nurture positive family relationships. Through FMS, parents can easily get access to family life programmes that help them better connect with their children.   

The objectives of the programme are :-
* Equip parents with the skills and knowledge to enrich and strengthen their family life; and foster better parent-child understanding and relationship  
* Equip students with life skills; skills to build healthy relationships with their peers and family; and/or imbue positive values and attitudes towards family relationship and life in general.
