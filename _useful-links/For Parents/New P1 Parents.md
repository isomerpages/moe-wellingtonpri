<h3>Administrative Matters</h3>

functions including receiving announcements from school, giving consent
for school programmes and activities, as well as declaration of travel
plans.

<p>You may download the free PG mobile app on your mobile phone (available
on iOS and Android platforms) and perform a simple one-time on boarding
process. Please refer to the following documents for additional information:</p>
