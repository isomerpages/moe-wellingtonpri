##### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  

**Q1: I have forgotten my password. What should I do?** <br>
Please refer to paragraphs 6-10 in Annex A. You may refer to [go.gov.sg/loginissues](http://go.gov.sg/loginissues) for all login issues.

**Q2: I have forgotten my username. What should I do?** <br>
The format of your user name is a combination of the first 5 characters of your Name, the last 4 digits and the letter of your NRIC/FIN/BC, e.g. (RACHE1234Z). In rare cases, two or more students might share the same 10 characters. In such cases, their username may be affixed with a number, e.g. (RACHE1234Z\_01). If you are still not sure of your username, please approach your teacher. 

**Q3: My account has been locked. What should I do?** <br>
Your account will be locked after 6 attempts to log in with an incorrect password. Please approach your teacher to reset your password. Alternatively, please click on the link below to request for a password reset.

**Q4: I used the “Password Reset Link Method” but I cannot find my password reset email. What can I do?** <br>
If you cannot see the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam or junk email folder. It is also possible that you have not keyed in or verified the email address in SLS. Note: The URL in the email will expire within 20 minutes. If the URL has expired, go to the login page and select "Forgot Password" to try again. Alternatively, please click on the link below to request for a password reset.

**Q5: Can I change the security questions?** <br>
Students can log in to SLS to change the answers to their security questions. However, the questions are fixed.

**Q6: What are the Operating System and Browser Requirements for SLS?** <br>
SLS is accessible through internet browsers on either Windows PC, Mac, iPad or Android tablets. For a good user experience, tablets should have a screen size of at least 7 inches. However, a small number of resources may not work on tablets due to missing plugins. Currently, SLS is not fully optimised to display on mobile phones even though users can access the system and resources. The recommended operating systems and browsers are:

| Operating System | Browser |
|---|---|
| Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 | • Google Chrome 64 and later |
| Microsoft Windows 1 | • Google Chrome 64 and later<br>• Microsoft Edge 17 and later |
