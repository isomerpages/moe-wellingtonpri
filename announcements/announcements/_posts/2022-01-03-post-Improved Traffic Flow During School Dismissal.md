Dear Parents/Guardians

To facilitate traffic flow without inconveniencing the residents during school dismissal at Gate D, the school would like to suggest the following traffic flow plan:

a. Enter car park only at Blk 507B <br>
b. Exit car park only at Blk 501B

Please see the attached document for details. We hope that with this arrangement, the safety of our students crossing the road at gate D (zebra crossing) could be enhanced.

Thank you.
