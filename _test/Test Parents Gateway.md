Parents Gateway

Parents Gateway (PG) is a mobile app specially designed for parents. The app allows parents to receive information and perform a range of administrative functions including receiving announcements from school, giving consent for school programmes and activities, as well as declaration of travel plans.

You may download the free PG mobile app on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms) and perform a simple one-time on boarding process. Please refer to PG One-Time Onboarding (Annex A) for the step-by-step instructions and [Frequently Asked Questions](https://ask.gov.sg/parentsgateway).
