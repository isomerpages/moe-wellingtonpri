### Student Leadership Framework

The SLD framework at Wellington Primary is designed to be aligned with the school’s vision, values and “5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership.” At the core of the framework is the outcome “Future-ready Leader”, which is in line with the school’s vision of ‘Becoming an excellent institution that grows future-ready leaders.’ The school believes that Wellingtonians must first be ‘anchored in Values’ in order to be developed into ‘Future-ready Leaders’. The middle ring represents the schools ‘RICE2’ values on which the basic foundation of leadership development is built. The framework is encircled by Kouzes and Posner’s 5 Practices in the outermost ring. The 5 Practices constitute the outward expressions of how students live out effective leadership and altruistic service, undergirded by the school values.
