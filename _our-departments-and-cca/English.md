##### English Language Teaching & Learning Approach @ Wellington  

The school’s approach to teaching and learning of the English Language is undergirded by the EL teaching processes (ACoLADE) in our EL classrooms to ensure effective and affective language use for all Wellingtonians by honing their EL skills, strategies, attitude and behaviour delineated in the following diagram.

     style="width:80%">

The EL approach is enacted through our department’s G.L.A.D. framework to equip our Wellingtonians to:  
1. Listen to, read and view critically and with accuracy, understanding and appreciation a wide, array of literary and informational texts in standard English from print, non-print and digital networked sources.
  
2. Speak, write and represent in standard English that is grammatical, fluent, intelligible and appropriate for different purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures.  
  
3. Use standard English grammar and vocabulary accurately and appropriately, and understand how speakers/writers put words together and use language to communicate meaning and achieve impact  

Together with G.L.A.D, the main pedagogical approach adopted in teaching English is STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading).  STELLAR pedagogy lends itself well to the development of 21st Century Competencies.  
   
STELLAR aims to strengthen both language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years through the use of well-established, learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches by using a range of authentic text types.

##### The three strategies at the lower-primary level:
* Shared Book Approach (SBA)   
* Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)  
* Learning Centres (LC)
   
##### The six strategies at the upper-primary level:  
* Supported Reading(SR)   
* Retelling  
* Know-Want to Know-Learnt (KWL)  
* Sentence Manipulation  
* Writing Process Cycle (WPC)  
* Differentiated Instruction (DI)
