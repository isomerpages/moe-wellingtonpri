The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight Programme is an MOE’s initiative to promote the use of Mother Tongue languages in schools. Here in Wellington Primary School, the programme provides students with authentic opportunities to experience and appreciate the various aspect of Malay Language and Culture. 

A wide range of activities are organised which include activities such as language appreciation through poetry and songs, hands-on session in traditional ensemble such as gamelan and kompang, unleashing the skills in the making of delicate traditional food craft and understanding the relevance of Malay Language in the current context through dialogue session with an invited speaker. These activities make the learning of the language fun and meaningful.

Leveraging on ICT, we made learning of the Malay language and culture more exciting even during the Circuit Breaker period. the Malay Department collaborated with the Aesthetic Department and encouraged students to submit a Mother Tongue Fortnight presentation in the online Well-ympics Challenge. The pupils enthusiastically submitted through the Student Learning Space (SLS) their lively performance which they recorded at the comfort of their home.
