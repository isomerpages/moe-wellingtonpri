Critical Thinkers, Creative Problem-solvers

##### Our Vision

Every child to be a confident problem solver of Mathematics

##### Our Mission

To develop in every child thinking, reasoning, communicative and metacognitive skills through real-world problem solving

### Department Goals
1. To acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills. 
2. To develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving.  
3. To develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics.  
4. To develop 21st-century like resilience, empowerment and self-mastery skills that are fundamental in helping students succeed in the future.

Daily use of [Concrete-Pictorial- Abstract (CPA) approach](http://www.mathsnoproblem.co.uk/concrete-pictorial-abstract) helps students to develop foundation concepts and skills that are necessary in everyday life. [Polya's 4-Step Problem-Solving Process](http://study.com/academy/lesson/polyas-four-step-problem-solving-process.html) is a school-wide approach to help students develop a structured action plan for addressing problem sums. [Online mathematics portal, Koobits](http://problemsums.koobits.com/), helps to provide additional learning resources and promotes self-directed learning in our students.
