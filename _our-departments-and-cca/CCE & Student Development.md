### Character and Citizenship Education &amp; Student Development

At Wellington, we believe strongly in the holistic development of our students. To achieve this end, the PWD team adopted a student-centric approach in ensuring our students are well-supported socially, emotionally and morally throughout their 6-year stay at Wellington. We have a team of teachers, counsellors and allied educators dedicated to developing and implementing programmes to provide for the total well-being of our students. We also work closely with MOE, our community partners such as Northwest CDC and police, and the School Advisory Committee (SAC) to provide timely support to cater to the varied needs of our students.
