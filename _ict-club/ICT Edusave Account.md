Edusave Account _(for Singapore Citizens only)_

All Singapore Citizen (SC) students have an Edusave account automatically opened for them and receive a yearly contribution. Parents can sign up for the Edusave standing order to use their child’s Edusave account to pay miscellaneous fees and enrichment programmes to reduce their cash out-of-pocket expenses.

Application is to be made via Parents Gateway (under Services tab) or the online [Edusave Standing Order](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5be24a1bb3f842000fdc4e59) Form. For details, please refer to the Information Sheet \[_create hyperlink to INFORMATION SHEET: EDUSAVE AND GIRO STANDING ORDER_\] or [Edusave Account | MOE](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/edusave-account).

You need to submit the FormSG by 20 January 2026 for it to take effect in the January-February MOE bill.
