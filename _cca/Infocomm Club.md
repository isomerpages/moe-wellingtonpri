The Infocomm Club comprises of two groups, Gamemaking and Audio Visual. During the studentsâ€™ 3-year journey into Digital Media, they learn gamemaking skill using Scratch, as well as digital photography, animation, movie-making and audio production. They also learn how to operate audio and visual equipment such as sound and light mixer.&nbsp;  

Membership is open to all Primary 4 to Primary 6 students who are keen to learn Gamemaking, photography and videography skills. Besides learning the various IT skills, students are given the opportunity to develop their leadership and presentation skills when they conduct workshops for non-Infocomm Club students. Selected students also represent the school in various Gamemaking and photography competitions. During the competitions, they interact with students from other schools and pick up IT skills along the way.&nbsp;

In 2019, a team of 5 students participated in National Primary Games Creation &amp; Coding Competition 2019. Our team won 1st Runner up in the Scratch category and the team leader also won the Best Presenter award.
