<p><strong>Photography</strong>
<br>The Photography module is introduced to Primary 3 students as part of
their foundational learning in digital media. This programme aims to nurture
students’ creativity, observation, and storytelling skills through photography.
It covers key areas such as camera handling, composition, lighting, photo
editing, and photojournalism. Students gain hands-on experience in both
studio and outdoor settings, participate in learning journeys, and build
personal portfolios. The club also instils values such as teamwork, integrity,
and empathy, with senior members taking on leadership roles and supporting
school events through event photography. Students strengthen their confidence,
communication, and critical thinking skills, fostering holistic character
development and essential 21st-century competencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Apple New Media (Basics)</strong>
<br>Through the Apple New Media programme, Primary 3 students equip themselves
with essential techniques for content creation utilizing their iPads. The
curriculum encompasses various subjects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Photography</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Videography</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augmented reality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital drawing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction to artificial intelligence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Podcasting</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>AI4K (Intermediate)</strong>
<br>Primary 4 students explore key Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts,
from AI algorithms, decision trees, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis
to chatbots and AI ethics. They also learn about data quality, facial detection
and recognition, pose estimation, recommendation engines, and reinforcement
learning, gaining practical experience and understanding of responsible
AI use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mobile App Development Using Thunkable</strong>
<br>Primary 4 students are introduced to Thunkable, a beginner-friendly platform
that enables app creation through visual coding. Through guided tutorials,
they explored key programming concepts such as events, variables, and logic
while designing simple apps like a music player and drawing pad. As their
skills developed, they worked collaboratively to design their own interactive
mobile apps, strengthening their teamwork, communication, and problem-solving
abilities. The project culminated in a mini showcase, where students presented
and demonstrated their apps to peers and Primary 2 students during the
Primary 2 CCA Experience. This enriching, hands-on experience not only
deepened their understanding of app development but also fostered creativity,
critical thinking, and a passion for innovation. Here are the mobile apps
which the students created:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>My First App</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animal Sound App</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guardians of Galaxy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whack a Pokemon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Southeast Asia Explorer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Book App</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ninja Training</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Website Creation Using HTML</strong>
<br>Primary 5 and Primary 6 students learn website creation using HTML through
hands-on projects that equip them with skills in structuring web pages,
formatting text, adding images, and integrating multimedia elements. Through
this programme, they not only strengthen their web development skills but
also develop collaboration, creativity, and social awareness as responsible
digital learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Game Development</strong>
<br>The programme introduces the Primary 5 students to game development using
MakeCode Arcade and Minecraft Education. Students learn to design and customize
sprites, apply game mechanics, and incorporate sound and animation while
exploring game design principles and storyboarding. In Minecraft Education,
they develop skills in building, coding with Redstone and command blocks,
and creating interactive game worlds. The programme concludes with a showcase
where participants present their final games and receive feedback.</p>
<p>This programme helps students develop coding and game design skills, creative
thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork. It also fosters confidence, resilience,
and innovation, equipping them with essential 21st-century competencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Game-making Using Scratch</strong>
<br>Using Scratch, Primary 5 students learn to code games through block-based
programming, gaining hands-on experience with coding concepts such as loops,
conditions, variables, events, and sequences. They begin by learning basic
coding principles to strengthen their foundation and understand algorithms
before progressing to actual game creation. Through the process, they develop
creativity and design skills by planning projects, designing characters
and backgrounds, and incorporating visual and audio elements. The platform
also nurtures problem-solving and critical thinking, as students debug,
refine, and logically sequence their code. Additionally, Scratch promotes
collaboration, communication, and 21st-century skills, helping students
build confidence, perseverance, and innovation while sharing ideas and
working on group projects.</p>
<p>Four teams of students had the opportunity to broaden their learning by
participating in two competitions (Singapore Infocomm Challenge SIC 2025,
National Primary Games Creation &amp; Coding Competition NPGC3). Through
these experiences, they strengthened their coding skills and developed
important qualities such as teamwork, organization, and time management
to achieve their goals effectively.</p>

<br><strong>Values in Action (VIA) Project</strong>
<br>As part of the VIA project, the Primary 5 ICT Leaders extend their learning
by guiding older adults in creating their own websites and teaching them
how to use Canva to design picture collages. This authentic teaching experience
enables students to apply their technical knowledge in real-world contexts
while developing patience, communication, and mentorship skills. By working
closely with the elderly, students also cultivate empathy, social awareness,
and a sense of community responsibility, gaining a deeper appreciation
for the importance of supporting others in embracing and learning new technologies.</p>
