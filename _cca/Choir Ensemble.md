<h4>Choir</h4>
<p>The <strong>Choir CCA</strong> provides students with opportunities to discover
the joy of singing together and to develop confidence in expressing themselves
through music. Through choral singing, students learn to listen attentively,
collaborate harmoniously, and strive for excellence as a team — skills
that nurture <strong>21st Century Competencies</strong> such as communication,
self-management, and global awareness.</p>
<p>Our choir members are guided to appreciate diverse musical styles, develop
vocal techniques, and cultivate discipline and teamwork. Beyond singing,
they build friendships, resilience, and a sense of pride in representing
the school.</p>
