The Wellington Choir aims to provide Wellingtonians with the platform to discover and harness their vocal talent through choral singing and show choir. Such opportunities enable Wellingtonians to not only work on their vocal range but also their stamina and synchronisation of movements. As choral singing is a team effort, the Wellington Choir firmly believes in the synergy of teamwork and resilience in order to put up a stellar performance.Â 

In 2019, the Wellington Choir attained the Platinum Award in the B-Dazzled Grand Festival. The choir also performs regularly at various school events such as the Annual Prize Giving Day ceremony.
