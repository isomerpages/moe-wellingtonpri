The Wellington Choir is dedicated to nurturing the vocal talents of Wellingtonians, offering them a platform to discover and develop their singing abilities through choral practices and performances. Engaging in these musical endeavors not only refines vocal techniques but also fosters self-discipline and confidence in all our choir members.

Our belief in the power of teamwork and resilience is at the core of our choir's philosophy, as we recognise that choral singing is a collaborative effort. Together, we strive for excellence in every performance.

Our practices are on Friday mornings during timetabled CCA periods, as well as selected Friday afternoons from 2pm to 4pm.

In 2023, we had the privilege of participating in several performances, including our school's Hari Raya concert and an external event hosted at Esplanade called "SYF 2023 Celebrations: Shall We Sing?".
