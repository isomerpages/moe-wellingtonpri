<h4>Guzheng Ensemble</h4>
<p>The Guzheng Ensemble of Wellington Primary School has proudly achieved
the Distinction Award at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
2024 — a title we’ve proudly held since 2010! Our members train hard and
play beautifully together, learning the importance of teamwork and resilience
along the way.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of our dedicated instructor, Ms Xu Yiping, and our
caring teachers, we practise every Friday morning and Monday afternoon.
Members are encouraged to practise at home too, so they can keep improving
and even take the Guzheng grading exams to earn music certificates!</p>
<p>Besides competitions, we also perform at school events and community shows,
sharing our love for the Guzheng with others. If you enjoy music and want
to be part of a fun and talented team, come join the Guzheng Ensemble —
where we make music, friendship, and memories together!</p>
