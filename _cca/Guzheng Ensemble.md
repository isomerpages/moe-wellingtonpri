The Guzheng Ensemble of Wellington Primary School participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2018 and clinched the Distinction Award, an honour we also held in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. Our students always train very hard for this illustrious event. The values the students have gleaned from the experiences are teamwork and resilience as they have to overcome their challenges and learn to perform well as a team.

The teachers-in-charge work hand-in-hand with our instructor, Ms Xu Yiping, in supporting our students. Practices are conducted on Friday mornings and Tuesday afternoons. The students are encouraged to practise the pieces daily in order to perfect them. They are also encouraged to sit for the Guzheng grading examinations.

In addition, the Guzheng Ensemble performs regularly at our school events and external events, such as the performance of Butterfly Lovers Concerto at the Victoria Theatre in August 2019.
