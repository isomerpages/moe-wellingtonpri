<h4>Malay Dance</h4>
<p><strong><em>Tari Wellington</em></strong>
<br>The Malay Dance Ensemble – ‘<em>Tari Wellington’</em>, is a vibrant and
close-knit group of 40 passionate dancers from Primary 3 to Primary 6 who
share a love for movement, culture, and tradition. Through graceful gestures
and rhythmic steps, our dancers bring the beauty of Malay heritage to life
on stage.</p>
<p>Over their three-year journey, members are immersed in the rich traditions
of Asli, Inang, Masri, Joget, and Zapin — dance forms that reflect the
diversity and elegance of the Malay world. Each routine tells a story of
joy, unity, and cultural pride, allowing our dancers to express themselves
creatively while learning about their roots.</p>
<p>Beyond mastering dance techniques, our ensemble emphasizes the core values
of discipline, respect, grace, and humility. Every dancer learns the importance
of teamwork, perseverance, and poise — qualities that shine both on stage
and in daily life. We believe that every dancer is a leader in their own
way, and we provide ample opportunities for them to develop confidence,
leadership, and stage presence.</p>
<p>Our dancers have represented the school in numerous performances and competitions,
gaining meaningful experiences and lasting friendships along the way. The
joy of performing together and celebrating milestones as a team makes the
journey truly memorable.</p>
