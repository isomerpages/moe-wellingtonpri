With 40 members, _Tari Wellington_ or Wellington Primary School’s Malay Dance team, is committed to showcasing the Malay culture through dance. We named ourselves "Tari Wellington" to build a strong bond and inculcate the sense of belonging among members.

Students learn the different traditional Malay dance sets, namely Asli, Inang, Masri, Joget and Zapin throughout their three years in the CCA. The dance team has evolved since we started and has nurtured distributed leadership skills among the students. Students take turns to be the leaders in the different segments of training - warm up segment, dance practice, cool down segment.

Our training sessions are conducted by trained instructors from Sri Warisan who are very passionate about Malay dance and they are able to pass on the passion for dance to the students well.

We believe in giving equal opportunity to all members to showcase their talents. Various platforms, either for internal or external events, are given to the dancers to showcase their capabilities and strengths. To ensure dancers are well-prepared for any performances, additional practices are held for the selected members in the afternoon.

Even though we were unable to hold practice sessions during the COVID-19 period, Tari Wellington was still able to contribute a dance item for the school’s online Hari Raya celebration. That is an example of how the dancers of Tari Wellington demonstrate dedication and resilience amidst all obstacles.
