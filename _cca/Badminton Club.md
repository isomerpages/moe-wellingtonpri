<h4>Badminton</h4>
<p>Badminton CCA serves to equip budding students with technical and tactical
badminton skills. Every player gets the opportunity to develop the basic
skills through drills and games with their peers. Students who demonstrate
greater potential through diligence and positive training attitude will
be invited for after-school training sessions.</p>
<p>These after-school training sessions are conducted by a professional coach
who is engaged by the school. Some of the students who attend the after-school
training sessions will be selected to represent the school in the annual
National School Games (NSG) competitions.</p>
