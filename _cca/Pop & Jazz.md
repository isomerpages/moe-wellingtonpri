Creative Dance incorporates a variety of dynamic dance forms; elements of ballet, jazz, hip hop, contemporary, modern and lyrical, into creative expressions of dance. Our vision is to provide for our students a holistic dance experience that imbues values, skills and character. Creative Dance strives to develop in the students an appreciation for dance and discover their strengths in dance. We offer students opportunities to showcase their dance talents within the school and at external performances. Meaningful student-centred activities are carried out to empower students to learn, interact, and develop friendships. With a motto of ‘dancing towards excellence’, we also aspire to nurture excellence in character development.

Our past achievements include performing at National Day Parade Heartlands 2019 - North West District, collaborating with Nanyang Polytechnic Dance club for the inaugural Dance Workshop 2019 and performing at Nanyang Polytechnic Arts Spectrum 2019. We also participated in giving back to the community via the Values in Action (VIA) initiatives at Singapore Christian Home and Minds School in 2019.
