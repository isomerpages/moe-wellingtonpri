<h4>Chinese Dance</h4>
<p>Wellington Primary School Chinese Dance Troupe develops our dancers not
only physically and aesthetically but also aims to foster in them an appreciation
of the Chinese Arts as well as instill in them discipline.</p>
<p>Our experienced instructors provide professional guidance and over time,
our dancers learnt skills that would improve their motor reflexes and present
themselves with grace and finesse. They are also taught various traditional
and contemporary dance techniques.</p>
<p>Through the CCA, our dancers learn the values of commitment, perseverance,
self-discipline, and the importance of teamwork. With our motto “When there
is a will, there is a way”, all dancers are encouraged to work towards
a common goal of attaining excellence, overcoming challenges and persevering
till the end.</p>
<p>Every year, our dancers perform in the school and at public places.&nbsp;
In addition, they also take part in the bi-annual nationwide Singapore
Youth Festival.</p>
