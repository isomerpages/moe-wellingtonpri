<h4>Wushu</h4>
<p>In Wushu CCA, students enhance their strength, flexibility, and coordination
through practicing fundamental techniques such as stable stances, precise
punches, powerful kicks, and agile jumps. They will also have the opportunity
to learn both basic and intermediate routines in fist and weapon forms,
gaining a deeper appreciation of the artistry and discipline behind this
traditional Chinese martial art.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond physical training, Wushu cultivates important life skills and values.
Through consistent practice, students develop focus, perseverance, and
self-discipline. They learn to work together as a team, show respect to
one another, and build confidence as they overcome challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As they progress, students are encouraged to perform during school events
and take part in competitions, including the <strong>National School Games</strong>,
where they proudly display their dedication and school spirit.</p>
