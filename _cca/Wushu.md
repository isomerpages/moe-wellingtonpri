<p>Wushu</p>
<p>Wushu is a Chinese martial arts that focuses primarily on hand &amp; arm
strikes and kicking techniques. Not only does it build strength and muscles,
it promotes flexibility, balance and coordination of movements. In addition,
it also develops discipline of character as students go through rigorous
training to master the different skills. Friendships are also forged through
teamwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Wushu styles also utilize traditional martial arts weapons such as
the cudgel, sword, broad sword and spear. Besides acquiring the fundamentals
of Wushu, our coaches train Wushu members to put up the lion dance performance
during Lunar New Year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school team members are given the opportunity to represent our school
in the National Wushu competitions where they hone their skills in a competitive
setting. They also perform during festive events such as the Lunar New
Year and Mid-Autumn festival.</p>
