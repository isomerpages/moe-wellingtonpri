The Indian Dance group shines as one of the vibrant performing arts groups in Wellington Primary School. The mission of the CCA is to empower every dancer, nurture their talent in Indian Dance and groom them to be leaders in the dance group.&nbsp;  

The Indian Dance tradition is thousands of years old. There are many different dance forms in Indian Dance and our dance group has performed varied genres of Indian Dance, which include both Classical and Folk dances. Through the dance group practice sessions and performances, the dancers grow and develop in the CCA as they learn to use all parts of their body; hands, feet and eyes to express the melody, meaning, rhythm and emotions of the dance.

The Indian Dance group has attained a Gold award in the Singapore Youth Festival. It also performs at various school and community events, such as:
* Performing Arts Night
* Deepavali Celebration
* Prize-Giving Day
* National Day Observance Ceremony @ Sembawang Community Club

The CCA is open to all Primary 3 to 6 students and the dance practice sessions are held every Friday from 7.45 to 9.45 a.m. Additional practice sessions are conducted after school if there are upcoming performances or competitions.&nbsp;
