Overview:<br>
The Art &amp; Crafts Club aims to provide our students opportunities and exposure in art making and art appreciation. Club members will learn to express their ideas, feelings and experiences through different art forms and mediums.&nbsp;<br>
Membership is open to all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who like to create, draw and paint. The Art &amp; Crafts Club allows them to learn a variety of art techniques and skills in various art mediums; from drawing, painting, mixed media and craft to digital art. Students will gain a greater understanding of concepts and ideas in fine art.<br>
Students are encouraged to represent the school in various art competitions and events. This year, our students took part in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Visual Arts Competition (Primary) 2023 and one group of our studentsâ€™ artwork was selected to be exhibited at the SYF Exhibition 2023.<br>  
Furthermore, selected art club students participated as student docents in our Artisticity Art Exhibition 2023. Also, all our art club members contributed interesting and beautiful artworks in the event.<br>
