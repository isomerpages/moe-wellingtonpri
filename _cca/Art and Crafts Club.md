The Visual Art Club aims to provide our students opportunities and exposure in art making and art appreciation. The club members will learn to express their ideas, feelings and experiences through different art forms and mediums. The objectives of the club are:
* To encourage creativity in students and develop for their self-expression in art.
* To foster a love in art among the students through their appreciation for visual arts.
* To strive for excellence through the participation in art competitions.

Membership is open to all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who like to create, draw and paint. The Visual Art Club allows them to learn a variety of art techniques and skills in various art mediums; from drawing, painting, mixed media and craft to digital art. Students will gain a greater understanding of concepts and ideas in fine art.

Students are encouraged to represent the school in various art competitions and events. Last year, our students took part in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Visual Arts Competition (Primary) 2019 and two groups of our studentsâ€™ artworks were selected to be exhibited at SYF Exhibition 2019.
