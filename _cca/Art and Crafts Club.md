<h4><strong>Art Club</strong></h4>
<p>The Art &amp; Crafts Club aims to provide our students opportunities and
exposure in art making and art appreciation. Club members will learn to
express their ideas, feelings and experiences through different art forms
and mediums.</p>
<p>Membership is open to all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who like to
create, draw and paint. The Art &amp; Crafts Club allows them to learn
a variety of art techniques and skills in various art mediums; from drawing,
painting, mixed media and craft to digital art. Students will gain a greater
understanding of concepts and ideas in fine art.</p>

and events. This year, our students took part in Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Visual Arts Competition (Primary) 2025, PAssionArts festival 2025
