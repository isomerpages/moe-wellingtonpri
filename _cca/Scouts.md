<h4><strong>Wellington Wolverine Cub Scout Unit&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The Wellington Cub Scouts Unit, which comprises boys and girls cubs, is
the only Uniformed Group CCA in school. The objective of the Cub Scouts
programme is to provide a group environment which is intellectually stimulating,
physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need
to face and overcome challenges. Self-development activities are well-entrenched
components of the overall drive towards encouraging “Fun &amp; Discovery”
amongst the Cubs. The activities are based on the natural sense of fun
and enthusiasm of the age group, thus the training is achieved primarily
through games, interaction in small groups and activities.</p>
<p>At the end of their time in the CCA, Cub Scouts from Primary 3 to Primary
6 would have achieved the following Progress Awards:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Bronze Arrow&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silver Arrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gold Arrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chief Scout’s Award – This is a National Award, and it is the highest
award, where a Cub Scout must hold the Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency
badges, show general knowledge of scouting and successfully complete an
interview with the District Commissioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each progress badge comprises tests for Citizenship, Leadership and Responsibility,
Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wellington Cub Scouts Unit has also seen a huge increase in enrolment
since 2012.&nbsp; From a unit with fewer than 30 Cub Scouts, it now has
105 Cub Scouts.&nbsp; The Cubs also had the opportunity to go on outings
with their Japanese counterparts, as well as meeting our President and
Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In 2016, Wellington Cub Scouts Unit achieved its first Frank Cooper Sands
Gold Award. This is awarded annually to schools for unit excellence. The
assessment for the award centres on Unit administration, Unit participation,
Training and Development, International Participation, Unit finances and
Unit Initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
