The Wellington Cub Scouts Unit, which comprises boys and girls cubs, is the only Uniformed Group CCA in school. The objective of the Cub Scouts programme is to provide a group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need to face and overcome challenges. Self-development activities are well-entrenched components of the overall drive towards encouraging “Fun & Discovery” amongst the Cubs. The activities are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm of the age group, thus the training is achieved primarily through games, interaction in small groups and activities.  

At the end of their time in the CCA, Cub Scouts from Primary 3 to Primary 6 would have achieved the following Progress Awards:
1. Bronze Arrow
2. Silver Arrow
3. Gold Arrow
4. Akela Award – This is a National Award, and it is the highest award, where a Cub Scout must hold the Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency badges, show general knowledge of scouting and successfully complete an interview with the District Commissioner.

Each progress badge comprises tests for Citizenship, Leadership and Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun.   

The Wellington Cub Scouts Unit has also seen a huge increase in enrolment since 2012. From a unit with fewer than 30 Cub Scouts, it now has 100 Cub Scouts. The Cubs also had the opportunity to go on outings with their Japanese counterparts, as well as meeting our President and Prime Minister.
