<h4>Football Club</h4>
<p>The Football CCA continues to be one of the most exciting and popular
sports in our school, drawing students who share a passion for the beautiful
game. Beyond developing footballing skills, the CCA instills in our players
important values such as teamwork, perseverance, discipline, and respect
— both on and off the pitch.</p>
<p>Throughout 2025, our players trained hard under the guidance of our dedicated
coaches. Each session focused on building not just technical ability, but
also teamwork, strategy, and mental strength. Members were also given opportunities
to represent the school in friendly matches and national tournaments, testing
their abilities against other schools while strengthening camaraderie and
school pride.</p>
<p>Our school’s football teams have made us proud once again with their outstanding
performances at the <strong>National School Games</strong>:</p>
<p>🏅 <strong>Senior Boys Team</strong> – <em>3rd Place in National League 2</em>
<br>The Senior Boys showed tremendous improvement and fighting spirit throughout
the season. Despite tough competition, the team displayed resilience and
unity, securing an impressive 3rd place finish in League 2. Their performance
reflects their hard work and commitment to continuous growth.</p>
