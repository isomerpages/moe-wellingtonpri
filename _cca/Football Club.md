In Wellington Primary, we aim to develop the passion for football in our young players under the guidance and expertise of the team of dedicated and experienced coaches and teachers. Through a journey of a structured and developmental approach in grooming a holistic sports person, Wellington Primary School has established itself as a soccer powerhouse in the North Zone. We not only focus on developing and honing the technical skills of our players, but also aim to develop them into responsible self-leaders and active contributors to society.   

Working tirelessly in the background to bring about the outstanding victories are our passionate and dedicated football teachers and coaches who have infused in the football players the spirit of discipline, resilience and teamwork in the pursuit of sports excellence on the field. 

This year, our Junior Boys participated in the Inter-School Football Championships under the new tiered competition format. For tiered-competitions, a classification round is used to determine the tier that the team would be playing in based on their competency. In the tiered round, each tier would be treated as a separate competition and the results in each tier should be independent of the results in the other tiers. Our junior boys managed to advance to the 2nd tier before the completion was halted and eventually cancelled due to the current situation. 

2020 was a promising year for the Senior Boys as morale was high after they finished runner up in the previous year. The boys had a great run in the North Zone competition, winning all the games that they played. Unfortunately, all National School Games had to be cancelled due to Covid-19.   

During the circuit breaker period, the teachers-in-charge found a way to keep the boys engaged in physical fitness, albeit in a setting that was unprecedented for all. Fitness videos and soccer drills were posted in the Student’s Learning Space for the boys to practice on their own at home. 

In preparation for the following year’s competition, the focus of our training sessions is on our boys’ technical skills as well as their fitness level during semester 2. At the same time, we will also identify talented players from the lower primary to join the CCA and develop their technical competencies and mould them into excellent players.
