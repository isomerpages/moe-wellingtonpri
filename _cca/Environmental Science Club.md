Green Innovation Club aims to develop an awareness among students in environmental conservation and protection. Efforts are made by the club to encourage students to deepen their commitment towards 5R initiatives – Replant, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Through various activities, we hope to inspire in them a love for nature and cultivate responsibility and care.   

In 2019, selected members from Green Innovation Club participated in National Youth Upcycling Movement (NYUM) competition and achieved the GOLD award. Club members were empowered to initiate a project and lead the team, raising awareness on upcycling in school and in the community. 

Every session, club members search for caterpillars in our school Butterfly Sanctuary. They are taught how to look after the caterpillars. Interested members are allowed to bring home the caterpillars and look after them before releasing them in our school Butterfly Sanctuary after they turn into butterflies. 

  

Besides that, students from Green Innovation Club are tasked to plant vegetables in the school’s garden. They acquire basic planting skills and the harvested vegetables are brought home by interested members. Leadership opportunities are given to Club members. Some CCAs sessions are allocated for them to guide their Lower Primary friends spot for caterpillars in our school Butterfly Sanctuary and to teach them how to classify the type of waste.
