<h4><strong>Environmental Science Club (Green Club)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Discover. Create. Protect.</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Environmental Science Club</strong> offers students an exciting
opportunity to explore the wonders of nature through <strong>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)</strong>.
Members take part in hands-on investigations, simple experiments, and creative
projects that promote environmental awareness and sustainable living. From
building solar cookers and wind turbines to crafting eco-friendly items,
students learn how science and innovation can make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Through school-wide and community-based green initiatives, our young Eco-Scientists
also learn to take responsibility for their surroundings and become active
contributors to a greener future.</p>
