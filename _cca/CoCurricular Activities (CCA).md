CCAs are offered in the school to emphasise on ‘Building Character’ in every student. Character traits like resilience, tenacity, confidence, perseverance, responsibility, teamwork, sportsmanship and respect are best acquired outside the classroom. Every student can explore interests, discover talents and recognise potential through the CCAs. These attributes prepare him /her to inculcate life skills beyond school.

The&nbsp;desired&nbsp;values&nbsp;are:
* Respect:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;show&nbsp;respect&nbsp;for&nbsp;self,&nbsp;others&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;environment
* Responsibility:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;exhibit&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;and&nbsp;leadership&nbsp;skills
* Integrity:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;show&nbsp;integrity&nbsp;in&nbsp;words&nbsp;and&nbsp;actions
* Innovation:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;innovate&nbsp;with&nbsp;persistence,&nbsp;exhibit&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;in&nbsp;actions&nbsp;and&nbsp;thoughts
* Courage:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;show&nbsp;courage&nbsp;by&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;and&nbsp;changing&nbsp;assumptions
* Care:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;show&nbsp;care&nbsp;to&nbsp;others&nbsp;and&nbsp;care&nbsp;for&nbsp;public&nbsp;property
* Excellence:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;strive&nbsp;for&nbsp;excellence&nbsp;and&nbsp;to&nbsp;stay&nbsp;on&nbsp;task
* Empowerment:&nbsp;The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;show&nbsp;empowerment&nbsp;through&nbsp;continuous&nbsp;learning&nbsp;and&nbsp;make&nbsp;a&nbsp;positive&nbsp;difference

The Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) Programme in Wellington Primary School seeks to provide all students with a holistic education through the teaching and learning of the three Character Development Domains: Leadership, Social &amp; Citizenship, in line with Social &amp; Emotional Framework SEL. Students acquire character traits like resilience, tenacity, confidence, perseverance, responsibility, teamwork, sportsmanship and respect and are given the opportunity to explore their interests, discover their talents and recognise their potential in their CCA.

In addition, participation in a CCA fosters social integration and deepens their sense of belonging to their school, community and nation. Through CCA, we hope to prepare them for life beyond school. As such, all P3 to P6 pupils are required to participate in at least one CCA. They may join a CCA from the Performing Arts, Sports Club, Uniformed Group or Clubs. CCA sessions are conducted on Fridays from 7.35 a.m. to 9.35 a.m. during curriculum time. However, additional training sessions might be scheduled for them. To maximise the full potential of every student, once he/she is accepted for the CCA, he/she will remain in the CCA for at least one year.
