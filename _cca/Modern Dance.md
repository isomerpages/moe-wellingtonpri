<p>Modern Dance in Wellington was proudly founded in 2013. We strive to develop
stage confidence in our students. During the CCA, they learn to dance in
various genres of Latin Dance, in particular Paso Doble, Jive, Cha Cha,
Rumba and Samba. Our instructors work with them to train and prepare them
for performances and competitions. Our dancers have performed at different
platforms to achieve individual and group awards for themselves and our
school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every year, students are given the opportunity to represent the school
in the Stars of Tomorrow International Ballroom Dancing Competition which
is held annually in Singapore. They get to interact with dancers and instructors,
who share the same fiery passion for dance, from different countries. They
also participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). *<strong>Note: This CCA requires dancers to purchase a pair of dance shoes at S$40/pair.</strong>
