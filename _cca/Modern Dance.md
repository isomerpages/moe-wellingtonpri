<h4>Modern Dance</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Modern Dance is an expressive and contemporary art form that blends elements
of ballet, jazz, lyrical and contemporary techniques into creative and
meaningful performances. Our vision is to provide students with a holistic
dance experience that nurtures both artistry and character. Through Modern
Dance, students develop grace, discipline, teamwork, and confidence while
exploring diverse styles and movement vocabularies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CCA offers students opportunities to showcase their talents in school
events and external platforms, inspiring a deeper appreciation for dance.
Student-centred activities foster collaboration, creativity, and friendship
among members. Guided by our motto <em>“Dancing Towards Excellence,”</em> Modern
Dance CCA strives to cultivate excellence not only in performance but also
in personal growth and character.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our troupe goes beyond mastering dance techniques, instilling core values
of discipline, respect, grace, and humility. Dancers cultivate teamwork,
perseverance, and poise—qualities that resonate on stage and in everyday
life. We nurture every dancer as a unique leader, fostering confidence,
leadership, and stage presence through diverse opportunities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Representing our school in external performances and competitions, our
dancers forge meaningful experiences and lifelong friendships while contributing
to the community through inspiring artistry and cultural expression. The
shared joy of performing and celebrating milestones as a united troupe
creates an unforgettable journey that shapes both heart and character.</p>
