Modern Dance in Wellington was proudly founded in 2013. We strive to develop stage confidence in our students. During the CCA, they learn to dance in various genres of Latin Dance, in particular Paso Doble, Jive, Cha Cha, Rumba and Samba. Our instructors work with them to train and prepare them for performances and competitions. Our dancers have performed at different platforms to achieve individual and group awards for themselves and our school.Â   

Every year, students are given the opportunity to represent the school in the Stars of Tomorrow International Ballroom Dancing Competition which is held annually in Singapore. They get to interact with dancers and instructors, who share the same fiery passion for dance, from different countries. They also participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).
