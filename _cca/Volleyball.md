<p>Volleyball is one of the world's most popular sports and is played by
more than 800 million people on the planet at least once a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game of volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a teacher
at a YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He combined parts of tennis, baseball,
basketball and handball to create a new game to be played indoors by people
who wanted less physical contact than basketball. Morgan borrowed the net
from tennis and raised it six feet and six inches above the floor, a little
higher than an average man's head.</p>
<p>The Volleyball Club started only last year to provide an opportunity for
girls to compete in sports. Over the last 1.5 years, the Primary 4 to Six
students have been hard at work honing their volleyball skills in digging,
passing, spiking and serving. The new intake of Primary 3 students this
year are also picking up the basic skills to prepare themselves for future
competitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To build on their playing experience, our Primary 4 students took part
in the Soft Volleyball Carnival. This year, our Primary 6 students took
part in the National School Games (NSG) Volleyball Senior Division and
gained a wealth of experience. Through it, they learnt the importance of
resilience, teamwork and discipline.</p>
<p>Membership is open to Primary 3 to 6 students who are interested to pick
up basic volleyball skills. Recruitment is open at the end of the year
to those who wish to join the CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CCA Training Days:</strong>
