CCAs are offered in the school to emphasise on ‘Building Character’ in every student. Character traits like resilience, tenacity, confidence, perseverance, responsibility, teamwork, sportsmanship and respect are best acquired outside the classroom. Every student can explore interests, discover talents and recognise potential through the CCAs. These attributes prepare him /her to inculcate life skills beyond school.

The desired values are:
* Respect: The ability to show respect for self, others and the environment
* Responsibility: The ability to exhibit responsibility and leadership skills
* Integrity: The ability to show integrity in words and actions
* Innovation: The ability to innovate with persistence, exhibit creativity in actions and thoughts
* Courage: The ability to  show courage by challenging and changing assumptions
* Care: The ability to show care to others and care for public property
* Excellence: The ability to strive for excellence and to stay on task
* Empowerment: The ability to show empowerment through continuous learning and make a positive difference

The Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) Programme in Wellington Primary School seeks to provide all students with a holistic education through the teaching and learning of the three Character Development Domains: Leadership, Social & Citizenship, in line with Social & Emotional Framework SEL. Students acquire character traits like resilience, tenacity, confidence, perseverance, responsibility, teamwork, sportsmanship and respect and are given the opportunity to explore their interests, discover their talents and recognise their potential in their CCA.
